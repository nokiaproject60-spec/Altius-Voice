# Precision Injection Retrieval Engine (PIRE)
Precision Injection Retrieval Engine is an enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system specifically engineered for the pharmaceutical industry. It bridges the gap between complex PDF documentation and actionable clinical insights through high-accuracy analysis and strict anti-hallucination protocols.

## Core Capabilities
In the pharmaceutical sector, "close enough" isn't good enough. PIRE is built on three foundational pillars:
Verified Citations: Every response is anchored to source coordinates (page numbers, paragraphs, and tables) within your PDF library.
Anti-Hallucination Guardrails: Employs multi-stage verification to ensure the model never "invents" clinical data or dosages.
Complex Document Parsing: Expertly handles multi-column layouts, chemical structures, and dense statistical tables common in regulatory filings.
